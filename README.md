chumby-multi-fx
===============

An audio effects platform based on the Chumby Hacker Board.

See http://wiki.chumby.com/index.php?title=Chumby_hacker_board_beta for more information on the Chumby Hacker Board.

These sources contain two variants of the same idea:
1. A Linux kernel module, meant to be built and loaded from the Chumby's OS.
2. A boot image, meant to be built and copied to a MicroSD card, as a replacement for the whole OS.

The final goal of this project is to create a DIY sound effects machine that uses the Chumby's line-in as audio input and uses the Chumby's headphone as audio output. The different parameters for the planned effects can be controlled either by connecting knobs and switches directly or by using MIDI connections and/or USB HID devices (to be done...)

This project is still work in progress, it is by no means an official product.
It comes as-is with no warranty.
